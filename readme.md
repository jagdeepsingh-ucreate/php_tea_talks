Clone the repo:
> ```git clone https://github.com/uCreate-Vishal/php_tea_talks.git ```

To create a new laravel project (sample/demo/POC), run the following commands from the repo folder:

> ```composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel PROJECT-NAME```

> ```cd PROJECT-NAME```

> ```composer install```

To use an existing POC (from the POCs folder), go to the POC of your choice and run composer (you might need to create vendor folder if the permissions to do so are not there - the system should let you know if that is the case)

> ```composer install```

Any followup instructions would be available in the project specific README file

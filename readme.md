Clone the repo:
> ```git clone https://github.com/uCreate-Vishal/php_tea_talks.git ```

To create a new laravel project (sample/demo/POC), run the following commands from the repo folder:

> ```composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel PROJECT-NAME```

> ```cd PROJECT-NAME```

> ```composer install```

To use an existing POC (from the POCs folder), go to the POC of your choice and run composer (you might need to create vendor folder if the permissions to do so are not there - the system should let you know if that is the case)

> ```composer install```

# Coding Guidelines
The set of rules that we follow when coding and performing code reviews of someone else's code.
It should be considered as a knowledge base, that anyone can contribute to.
If you spot a bad practice during the code review, and it is possible to describe it in generic way,
feel free to open a Pull Request with point added to the list.
